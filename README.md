cognition-caps
==============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhanson/cognition-caps.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lhanson/cogniton-caps)

This is the software which formerly ran the
[Cognition Caps website](http://www.wearcognition.com) (now defunct).

It's written in Clojure because it's awesome and I'm silly like that.

Setup
=====
For Heroku deployment, we need to set the database credentials
[in environment variables](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#local-setup).
For local development and migration work against other databases we'll read
settings from a local file, so rename datasource.properties.example and enter
the credentials there.
